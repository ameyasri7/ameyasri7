      "content": "# Sub-11 Personal Best! üéâ\n\nToday I achieved something I've been working towards for months - a **10.56 second solve**! This is my first sub-11 solve and I'm absolutely thrilled.\n\n## What made this solve special:\n- **Perfect cross execution** - 4 moves, no pauses\n- **Smooth F2L pairs** - great look-ahead throughout\n- **Fast OLL recognition** - knew the case immediately\n- **Quick PLL execution** - U-perm in under 1 second\n\n## The solve breakdown:\n- Cross: ~1.2 seconds\n- F2L: ~5.8 seconds\n- OLL: ~2.1 seconds\n- PLL: ~1.4 seconds\n\nThis gives me confidence that I can consistently break the 12-second barrier. My goal now is to get more sub-11 solves and work towards a sub-10 PB!\n\n## Next steps:\n- Practice cross efficiency\n- Improve F2L look-ahead\n- Learn more OLL cases\n- Work on PLL recognition speed",

      "content": "## OLL Learning Journey\n\nI've been working on learning Full OLL for the past few months, and I'm making steady progress. Currently at **42/57 cases learned**.\n\n### Recently learned cases:\n1. **OLL 21** - The classic 'Sune' case\n2. **OLL 22** - The 'Anti-Sune' case\n3. **OLL 23** - The 'H' case\n4. **OLL 24** - The 'Pi' case\n5. **OLL 25** - The 'U' case\n\n### Practice strategy:\n- **10 minutes daily** dedicated to OLL drilling\n- **Recognition practice** with timer pressure\n- **Algorithm refinement** for speed\n- **Case grouping** by similarity\n\n### Impact on my solves:\nMy average has dropped from ~14.5 to ~13.5 seconds since starting Full OLL. The recognition speed is improving, and I'm getting fewer 'slow' OLLs.\n\n### Remaining cases (15 left):\n- OLL 26-30: Various corner cases\n- OLL 31-35: Edge orientation cases\n- OLL 36-40: Mixed cases\n\nGoal: Complete Full OLL by the end of February! üìö",

      "content": "## F2L Efficiency Deep Dive\n\nI've been analyzing my F2L efficiency lately and found some interesting patterns in my solves.\n\n### Current F2L performance:\n- **Average F2L time**: ~6.2 seconds\n- **Best F2L time**: ~4.8 seconds (in my 10.56 PB)\n- **Worst F2L time**: ~8.1 seconds (in slow solves)\n\n### Common inefficiencies I've identified:\n1. **Rotations**: Too many cube rotations during F2L\n2. **Look-ahead**: Pausing between pairs\n3. **Pair insertion**: Not using optimal algs for some cases\n4. **Cross to F2L transition**: Hesitation after cross\n\n### Improvement strategies:\n\n#### 1. Reduce Rotations\n- Learn **rotationless F2L** cases\n- Practice **back slot** insertions\n- Use **wide moves** when beneficial\n\n#### 2. Improve Look-ahead\n- **Drill F2L pairs** without timer\n- Practice **slow solves** focusing on look-ahead\n- Use **metronome training** for rhythm\n\n#### 3. Optimize Algorithms\n- Learn **advanced F2L** cases\n- Practice **multislotting** techniques\n- Master **keyhole** method for some cases\n\n### Target goals:\n- **F2L average**: Sub-5.5 seconds\n- **Consistency**: Less than 2-second variance\n- **Look-ahead**: No pauses between pairs\n\nThis should help me break the 10-second barrier consistently! üéØ",
